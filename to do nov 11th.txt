TO DO

Implement so that the opponent will use faceup cards when their hand is depleted
possibly by looping through them and adding them to their hand, but need a way to put them back as well.

Got it so that the select card will also look to the face ups if the initial hand is empty, but it doesn't assess whether the faceup cards are playable I think, Line 282
